    <ol>
         <li class="li" >Contact information</li>
        <p>If you require any information or clarification regarding the use of your Personal Information (defined below) or this Privacy Notice or if you require any general information or clarification or inquiry regarding the Platform please email us at <mark>trumpcartshoppy@gmail.com</mark></p>
         <li class="li">Objective and Scope</li>
        <p>Please also keep in observance that our sites and applications may contain links to other sites not owned or controlled by us and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our sites or applications and to read the privacy policies of other sites that may collect your Personal Information.</p>
         <li class="li">Collection of Personal Information</li>
        <p>Where we refer to 'Personal Information' we mean any information related to a particular individual who we identify (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual or natural person. This includes direct identifiers such as your name, postal address, email address, and mobile number, and also includes all other information which is linked to that information such as your location. Where we refer to “ID” we mean a list of numbers and/or letters (also known as a numeric or alphanumeric string) which we or our service providers may generate and which is used as a means to give you a unique customer or user identifier – it cannot directly identify personally but it may be able to do so where your Personal Information is associated with it.</p>
         <li class="li">Payment Card and Billing Information</li>
        <p>When you purchase a subscription package using one or more of our payment gateway service providers, or any other online or mobile payment services provider we may use (including through any app stores), the following payment information will be collected: your credit/debit card details (number, card expiry date, CVC code) or other bank account details along with the date, time and amount of the transaction payment. This payment information is stored by our payment processors and associated with a merchant name/ID and location which our payment processor gives to us, together with a unique customer ID which we share with them but this payment information is never stored or processed by us. Our payment processors use this payment information to process and facilitate the payment of your subscription fee in order that we may provide you with the service you have requested or to enter into a contract with you to access the Platform (in other words to perform the contract). So that we know you have paid your subscription fee our payment processors will send us a unique transaction ID which we associate with your unique customer ID and which we keep for internal accounting purposes because we have a legal obligation to do so.</p>
         <li class="li">Managing Your Information</li>
        <p>You can access some of your Personal Information through the 'My Account' section of the Platform after a successful login. You are responsible for providing us with your accurate Personal Information and keeping your Personal Information up-to-date.</p>
         <li class="li">Children's Privacy</li>
        <p>We do not knowingly permit any person who is under 18 years of age to register or to provide any other personally identifying information. Please do not register with us if you are below 18 years of age. If we become aware that any Personal Information of persons less than 18 years of age has been collected on the Platform without verified parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete any such information.</p>
         <li class="li"> Data transfer, storage & processing globally</li>
        <p>We operate globally and may transfer your Personal Information to Star affiliated companies or service providers or third-party recipients to whom we provide technology and hosting services, in locations around the world for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. Accordingly, by consenting to this Privacy Notice, you also provide consent to Star to transfer your Personal Information to Star affiliated companies or service providers or such third-party recipients in locations around the world. Wherever your Personal Information is transferred, stored or processed by us or our affiliates or service providers, we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your Personal Information.</p>
         <li class="li">Security</li>
        <p>We are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration. Some of the safeguards we use to protect your information are firewalls and data encryption, and information access controls. These measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks of processing your Personal Information.
